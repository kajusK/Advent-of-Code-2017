Advent of code 2017
===================

My first attempt of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2017/) challenge
in python. The code is heavily unoptimized, once I got a result I moved to a next
day, also as I was very new to the python, the code is not a very good example
to learn from, it's rather a documented way of me learning python.
